# Reproducibility Attestation System for Computational Research

## Executive Summary

This document describes a system design for **darnit-reproducibility**, an extension to the darnit compliance framework that enables automated reproducibility verification and attestation for computational research software. The system addresses a critical gap in scientific computing: the inability to reliably rebuild and re-execute research software (e.g., protein folding simulations, molecular dynamics, genomics pipelines) in deterministic ways.

The system operates in two primary flows:

1. **Reproducibility Analysis & Environment Generation**: Ingests build provenance data from CNCF Witness (including future eBPF-based tracing) to analyze execution environments and generate reproducible environment definitions (containers, HPC configurations, Nix derivations)
2. **Re-execution & Attestation Storage**: Executes reproducible builds, generates cryptographically-signed reproducibility attestations, and stores them in OpenSSF GUAC for queryable provenance

## How It Works: End-to-End Workflow

This section explains the complete workflow in plain language, walking through how a researcher would use this system and how the components interact to achieve reproducible computational research.

### The Core Insight

The fundamental challenge in computational research reproducibility is that researchers don't know what they don't know. When a scientist runs a protein folding simulation on their university's HPC cluster, they might carefully document their Python version and the input data—but they often miss the dozens of implicit dependencies: the specific version of CUDA, the OpenBLAS library linked at compile time, the exact compiler flags, or even environment variables that subtly affect numerical precision.

Our system solves this by inverting the problem: instead of asking researchers to document everything (which they inevitably get wrong), we **observe everything automatically** during execution, then **analyze** what we observed to understand reproducibility requirements, and finally **generate** the artifacts needed to reproduce the computation elsewhere.

### Phase 1: Capturing Execution with Witness

When a researcher runs their computational workflow, they wrap it with CNCF Witness:

```bash
witness run \
    --step protein-fold \
    --attestations environment git product command_run \
    -- python run_simulation.py --input data.pdb
```

Witness acts as an observability layer around the build/execution. With its current attestors, it captures:

- **Environment**: Operating system, hostname, environment variables (PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, CUDA paths)
- **Git state**: Exact commit hash, branch, remotes, tags
- **Command**: What was run, exit code, stdout/stderr hashes
- **Products**: Output files with their cryptographic digests

With the **future eBPF-based attestors** (currently in development), Witness will also capture:

- **Every process executed**: gcc invocations, nvcc calls, Python subprocess spawns
- **Every file read**: Header files, shared libraries, configuration files—with their digests
- **Every file written**: Intermediate build artifacts, output files
- **Network connections**: Package downloads during build, external API calls
- **Shared library loads**: The actual .so files loaded at runtime

This eBPF-based tracing is transformative because it captures the **actual execution** rather than what the build system *says* should happen. A Makefile might specify `gcc`, but eBPF tracing reveals that `/usr/bin/gcc-11` was actually invoked with specific flags, and that it read 47 header files from specific paths.

### Phase 2: Analyzing Provenance with Darnit

Once we have a Witness attestation bundle, Darnit's provenance analyzer processes it to understand what's actually required for reproducibility:

**Step 2.1: Building the Dependency Graph**

Darnit parses the Witness bundle and constructs a complete dependency graph. From the eBPF file access traces, it identifies:

- System packages accessed (by matching file paths to package managers)
- Python packages used (by analyzing imports and site-packages paths)
- Shared libraries loaded (from LD_LIBRARY_PATH and dlopen calls)
- Compilers and their versions (from execve traces)
- Hardware requirements (from CUDA library loads, MPI calls, GPU device access)

For example, if the eBPF trace shows:
- Read `/usr/local/cuda-12.0/include/cuda_runtime.h`
- Loaded `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudart.so.12`
- Executed `/usr/local/cuda-12.0/bin/nvcc --gpu-architecture=sm_80`

Darnit infers: "This computation requires CUDA 12.0, targets the Ampere GPU architecture (sm_80), and needs the CUDA runtime library."

**Step 2.2: Identifying Gaps with LLM Assistance**

Not everything can be deterministically inferred. When Darnit encounters ambiguity—perhaps a configuration file that could come from multiple packages, or a library that might have been statically compiled—it escalates to an LLM consultation.

Using darnit's sieve pipeline, the system presents the LLM with:
- The file in question
- Surrounding context from the provenance graph
- Possible interpretations

The LLM responds with its best inference and a confidence score. If confidence is too low, the system flags it for manual review.

**Step 2.3: Recommending Target Environments**

Based on the analysis, Darnit recommends the best environment type:

| Detected Requirements | Recommendation |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Standard Python + pip packages | **Container** (Docker/Singularity) |
| GPU + CUDA + single-node | **Container** with nvidia-container-toolkit |
| MPI + multi-node | **HPC job script** (Slurm/PBS) |
| Complex native dependencies | **Nix** for maximum reproducibility |
| Mixed MPI + GPU | **HPC** with Spack environment |

The recommendation includes a confidence score and explains the reasoning: "Recommending Singularity container (confidence: 0.87) because: requires CUDA 12.0 (detected), single-node execution (no MPI detected), common in HPC environments where Docker is unavailable."

### Phase 3: Generating Reproducible Environments

Based on the provenance analysis, Darnit generates the artifacts needed to reproduce the computation:

**For Containers (Docker/Singularity)**:

Darnit renders a Dockerfile that:
1. Starts from an appropriate base image (detected from CUDA version, OS, etc.)
2. Installs system packages identified in the dependency graph
3. Installs Python packages with pinned versions from the provenance
4. Sets environment variables captured by Witness
5. Copies source code and builds with the exact flags observed
6. Includes reproducibility settings (SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, etc.)

For HPC environments, it also generates a parallel Singularity definition file, since many clusters don't allow Docker.

**For HPC Clusters (Slurm/PBS)**:

Darnit generates:
1. A job script with correct resource requests (GPUs, memory, nodes)
2. Module load commands mapped from the detected dependencies
3. Environment variable exports
4. A Spack environment file for dependency management

**For Nix**:

Darnit generates a `flake.nix` that pins the exact nixpkgs revision and declares all dependencies. This provides the strongest reproducibility guarantees—running `nix build` will produce identical results regardless of the host system.

### Phase 4: Verification Through Re-execution

This is where Darnit goes beyond just "generating a Dockerfile." The system actually **verifies** reproducibility by re-executing the computation and comparing results.

**Step 4.1: Execution with Tracing**

Darnit builds the generated environment and runs the computation inside it, again with Witness tracing enabled:

```bash
# Darnit orchestrates this internally
witness run \
    --step reproducibility-verification \
    --attestations environment git product command_run \
    -- docker run repro-build:latest python run_simulation.py
```

This produces a second Witness attestation bundle capturing what happened during the reproduction attempt.

**Step 4.2: Comparison and Verdict**

Darnit compares the original and reproduction attestation bundles:

**Bit-for-bit comparison**: Do the output file digests match exactly?
- If yes: The build is **fully reproducible**
- If no: Continue to semantic comparison

**Semantic comparison**: Are the outputs functionally equivalent?
- For scientific computations, Darnit can apply domain-specific comparisons
- Floating-point results might differ in the last few ULPs due to instruction ordering
- Trajectory files might have different timestamps but identical physics
- Machine learning models might have identical accuracy despite different weight values

**Discrepancy Analysis**: When outputs don't match, Darnit analyzes why:
- Compare environment attestations: Did a dependency version drift?
- Compare file access traces: Were different headers/libraries used?
- Flag numerical precision issues vs. actual logic differences

This analysis produces a **reproducibility verdict**:
- ✅ **Fully Reproducible**: Bit-for-bit identical outputs
- ✅ **Semantically Reproducible**: Outputs differ but are functionally equivalent
- ⚠️ **Partially Reproducible**: Some outputs match, others don't (with explanation)
- ❌ **Not Reproducible**: Significant differences (with root cause analysis)

### Phase 5: Remediation When Things Don't Match

When Darnit detects that a reproduction attempt failed or produced different results, it triggers a **remediation flow**:

**Step 5.1: Root Cause Identification**

Darnit's analyzer compares the two provenance graphs to identify discrepancies:

```text
Original environment:
  - Python 3.10.12
  - numpy 1.24.3 (linked against OpenBLAS 0.3.21)
  - CUDA 12.0, driver 525.85

Reproduction environment:
  - Python 3.10.12 ✓
  - numpy 1.24.3 ✓ (but linked against OpenBLAS 0.3.23!) ← DISCREPANCY
  - CUDA 12.0 ✓, driver 530.30 ← DISCREPANCY
```

**Step 5.2: Suggesting Fixes**

Based on the identified discrepancies, Darnit suggests remediation:

1. **Stricter pinning**: "Pin OpenBLAS to 0.3.21 in the Dockerfile"
2. **Environment isolation**: "Use a container that bundles the exact CUDA driver"
3. **Numerical tolerance**: "If results differ only in floating-point precision, consider adding tolerance to comparisons"

**Step 5.3: Iterative Refinement**

Darnit can automatically apply suggested fixes and re-run verification:

```text
Iteration 1: Reproduction failed (OpenBLAS version mismatch)
  → Applied fix: Pinned libopenblas-dev=0.3.21
Iteration 2: Reproduction failed (CUDA driver mismatch)
  → Applied fix: Using nvidia/cuda:12.0.0-base-ubuntu22.04 base image
Iteration 3: Reproduction succeeded (bit-for-bit match)
  → Generated final attestation
```

This iterative approach means researchers don't have to manually debug reproducibility failures—the system identifies and fixes issues automatically.

### Phase 6: Publishing Attestations to GUAC

Once reproducibility is verified, Darnit publishes the attestation to OpenSSF GUAC:

**Step 6.1: Creating the Attestation**

Darnit generates an in-toto attestation with a custom reproducibility predicate:

```json
{
  "_type": "https://in-toto.io/Statement/v1",
  "subject": [{"name": "protein_sim", "digest": {"sha256": "abc123..."}}],
  "predicateType": "https://darnit.dev/attestations/reproducibility/v1",
  "predicate": {
    "original": {"witness_bundle": "...", "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"},
    "reproduction": {"witness_bundle": "...", "timestamp": "2024-01-20T14:45:00Z"},
    "verdict": {
      "reproducible": true,
      "level": "bit_for_bit",
      "confidence": 0.99
    },
    "environment_comparison": {...},
    "artifact_comparison": {...}
  }
}
```

**Step 6.2: Signing with Sigstore**

The attestation is cryptographically signed using Sigstore's keyless signing:
- Researcher authenticates via their institution's OIDC provider
- Sigstore issues a short-lived certificate
- The attestation is signed and the signature is logged in Rekor (transparency log)

This creates a **non-repudiable, publicly-verifiable claim** that this researcher verified reproducibility at this time.

**Step 6.3: Publishing to GUAC**

Darnit pushes the signed attestation to GUAC via its GraphQL API:

```graphql
mutation {
  ingestHasMetadata(
    subject: {artifact: {algorithm: "sha256", digest: "abc123..."}},
    hasMetadata: {
      key: "https://darnit.dev/attestations/reproducibility/v1",
      value: "{...attestation JSON...}",
      origin: "darnit-reproducibility",
      collector: "darnit"
    }
  )
}
```

Now the attestation is part of the GUAC graph, linked to the artifact it describes.

### Phase 7: Querying Reproducibility History

Once attestations are in GUAC, anyone can query them:

**"Has this software artifact ever been independently reproduced?"**

```graphql
query {
  HasMetadata(hasMetadataSpec: {
    subject: {artifact: {digest: "abc123..."}},
    key: "https://darnit.dev/attestations/reproducibility/v1"
  }) {
    id
    value  # Contains the full attestation
    timestamp
    origin  # Who verified it
  }
}
```

**"Show me all reproducibility verifications for this research group's outputs"**

**"What percentage of artifacts from this lab have been independently verified?"**

This transforms reproducibility from a binary "trust the paper" to a **queryable, cryptographically-verified property** of research software.

### The Feedback Loop

The system creates a virtuous cycle:

1. **Initial runs** are traced with Witness, capturing complete provenance
2. **Analysis** identifies what's needed for reproducibility
3. **Generation** creates environment definitions automatically
4. **Verification** attempts reproduction and identifies failures
5. **Remediation** fixes issues automatically or flags for human review
6. **Attestation** creates cryptographic proof of reproducibility
7. **Publication** makes the proof queryable in GUAC
8. **Future verifications** can build on existing attestations

Over time, this creates a **reproducibility knowledge graph** where:
- Software artifacts are linked to their build provenance
- Reproducibility attempts are recorded with their verdicts
- Common failure modes are identified across the research community
- Best practices emerge from successful reproduction patterns

### Example: A Day in the Life

**Dr. Chen publishes a protein folding paper:**

1. Her simulation already runs with Witness tracing (standard practice in her lab)
2. Before submission, she runs `darnit verify-reproducibility`
3. Darnit analyzes the provenance, generates a Singularity container, and verifies reproduction
4. Two iterations needed: fixed a floating numpy version and an unset random seed
5. The reproducibility attestation is signed and published to GUAC
6. Her paper includes a GUAC URI that reviewers can query

**Dr. Park wants to build on her work:**

1. He queries GUAC for her artifact's reproducibility attestations
2. Sees it was independently verified by three labs with bit-for-bit matches
3. Downloads the Singularity definition from the attestation
4. Runs it on his cluster—works first time
5. Makes modifications, runs Darnit to verify his version is also reproducible
6. Publishes his own attestation referencing hers

**Journal reviewer checks the submission:**

1. Queries GUAC for the artifact digest mentioned in the paper
2. Sees the full provenance chain: who built it, when, with what dependencies
3. Sees independent verification from multiple institutions
4. Can verify the signatures are valid and logged in Rekor
5. Has much higher confidence in the computational results

## Problem Statement

### The Reproducibility Crisis in Computational Science

Computational research software—protein folding simulations (AlphaFold, OpenMM), molecular dynamics (GROMACS, LAMMPS), genomics pipelines (BWA, GATK)—suffers from severe reproducibility challenges:

1. **Environment Opacity**: Researchers run computations without capturing complete environment state (system libraries, compiler versions, hardware configurations)
2. **Build Non-Determinism**: Software builds vary based on undocumented dependencies, floating version pins, and implicit system state
3. **Execution Variance**: Results differ across HPC clusters, cloud environments, and local machines due to numerical precision, threading, and hardware differences
4. **Verification Gap**: No standardized way to attest that a computational result was produced by a specific version of software in a known environment

### Current State

| Challenge | Current Approach | Gap |
|-----------|------------------|-----|
| Environment capture | Manual documentation, Dockerfiles | Incomplete, post-hoc, not verified |
| Build provenance | CI logs, makefiles | No cryptographic binding, lossy |
| Execution verification | "Works on my machine" | No attestation, not queryable |
| Result provenance | Paper citations | No machine-readable chain |

### Sieve Integration

The reproducibility system reuses darnit's sieve pipeline for verification:

```python
# Example: Using sieve to verify reproducibility controls

async def verify_reproducibility(local_path: str) -> SieveResult:
    """Verify reproducibility controls using the sieve pipeline."""

    orchestrator = SieveOrchestrator()
    impl = ReproducibilityImplementation()

    results = []
    for control in impl.get_all_controls():
        result = await orchestrator.verify(
            control,
            CheckContext(
                local_path=local_path,
                project_config=load_project_config(local_path)
            )
        )
        results.append(result)

    return results
```

## Use Cases for Computational Research

### Use Case 1: Protein Folding Simulation

```text
Researcher runs AlphaFold on their HPC cluster:

1. Initial Run (with Witness):
   $ witness run \
       --step protein-fold \
       --attestations environment git product command_run \
       -- python run_alphafold.py --target protein.fasta

2. Witness captures:
   - CUDA version, driver, GPU model
   - Python environment, packages
   - Input data hashes
   - Output structure hashes

3. Darnit analyzes and generates:
   $ darnit analyze-reproducibility \
       --witness-bundle protein-fold.witness.json

   Output: Recommends Singularity container for HPC portability

4. Generate reproducible environment:
   $ darnit generate-env \
       --target hpc \
       --witness-bundle protein-fold.witness.json

   Creates: Singularity.def, spack.yaml, run.slurm

5. Another researcher reproduces:
   $ darnit execute-reproducible \
       --environment Singularity.def \
       --original protein-fold.witness.json

   Generates: reproducibility attestation

6. Publish to GUAC:
   $ darnit publish-to-guac \
       --attestation repro-attestation.json

   Creates: Queryable provenance in GUAC graph
```

### Use Case 2: Molecular Dynamics (GROMACS)

```text
HPC workflow with MPI and GPU:

1. Witness captures during original run:
   - MPI implementation (OpenMPI 4.1.5)
   - GROMACS version, build flags
   - GPU kernel hashes
   - Input topology files
   - Energy/trajectory outputs

2. Darnit analysis identifies:
   - MPI requirement → HPC environment preferred
   - Specific GPU architecture → CUDA constraint
   - Memory requirements → Resource allocation

3. Generated artifacts:
   - Slurm job script with correct resource requests
   - Spack environment for GROMACS + dependencies
   - Reproducibility verification script

4. Attestation captures:
   - Environment equivalence (or differences)
   - Energy conservation (semantic reproducibility)
   - Trajectory divergence metrics
```

## NSF Proposal Integration Points

### Intellectual Merit

1. **Novel reproducibility verification framework** that bridges supply chain security (Witness, GUAC) with scientific computing reproducibility
2. **LLM-assisted environment inference** using darnit's sieve pipeline to fill gaps in captured provenance
3. **Multi-environment generation** from single provenance source (containers, HPC, Nix)
4. **Cryptographic reproducibility attestations** that create verifiable claims about computational results

### Broader Impacts

1. **Reproducibility crisis solution** for computational biology, chemistry, physics
2. **Open source tools** that any research lab can adopt
3. **Standards development** for reproducibility attestation formats
4. **Training materials** for researchers on reproducibility best practices

### Technical Innovation

1. **eBPF-based provenance capture** (via Witness) provides complete execution trace without code modification
2. **Graph-based provenance storage** (via GUAC) enables complex queries about software lineage
3. **Progressive verification** (via sieve) scales from simple checks to LLM-assisted analysis
4. **Attestation chain** creates cryptographic proof of reproducibility
